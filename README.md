Issue Tracker for CS240 eastwood linter

**Before posting:** make sure that your code compiles with the course C standard **c99**. If you have code that is not syntactially valid then you should be getting a syntax error from the linter. That said if the code compiles properly and you are getting a syntax error then it should be reported here. There are features of later standards, c11, and gnu extensions, gnu99, which are not supported.

This is a public issue tracker so **DO NOT** post chunks of your homework code here. Please just describe what you are seeing and if we are unable to replicate the bug then we may ask you to email us the code.
